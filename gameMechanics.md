# Game Mechanics

+ radius of anything = (mass / 2) units
+ decay of cell = (0.002 * mass) units s<sup>-1</sup>
+ Minimum mass for split = 36 units
+ mass of virus = 70 units
+ initial mass of cell = 20 units
+ Minimum mass for eating a virus = 130 units
+ Speed of a cell = 2.2 * (mass <sup>-0.439</sup>) units s<sup>-1</sup>
+ Maximum children = 16
+ Number of viruses are fixed for a map. If a virus is eaten then it re-emerges imediately.
+ Time for the children of same bot to merge = max(30, mass*0.2)
+ Map dimensions = 14142 X 14142 units <sup>2<sup>
+ Distance travelled after split with respect to both the radiuses = 820 + r1 + r2 units (velocity = 0.59 units s<sup>-1</sup>)
+ Each food mass = 2 units
+ Each eject mass = 2 units
+ minimim mass of cell to eject mass = 20 units
+ 1 tick = 1 unit displacement by cell mass 20 units (1 tick = 1.69 sec)
